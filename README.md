# Design and Implementation of a PCB with an Arduino for Measuring Temperature, Light, Pressure, and Alcohol Levels in Real Time

This repository contains the code for the project "**Design and Implementation of a PCB with an Arduino for Measuring Temperature, Light, Pressure, and Alcohol Levels in Real Time**". The goal of the project is to collect, process, and visualize diverse sensor data in real-time to help humans monitor the conditions of their environment.

This repository is organised as follows:
- The `Arduino.m` file is used to process and visualize the data acquired from all the sensors
- The `sketch_apr20.ino` is used to configure the Arduino board properly before interfacing with the sensors and the PC host.
