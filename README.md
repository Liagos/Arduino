# Design and Implementation of a PCB with an Arduino for Measuring Temperature, Light, Pressure, and Alcohol Levels in Real Time

This repository contains the code for the project "**Design and Implementation of a PCB with an Arduino for Measuring Temperature, Light, Pressure, and Alcohol Levels in Real Time**". The goal of the project is to collect, process, and visualize diverse sensor data in real-time to help humans monitor the conditions of their environment.

This repository is organised as follows:
- The `Arduino.m` file is used to process and visualize the data acquired from all our sensors
- The `sketch_apr20.ino` is used to configure the Arduino board properly before interfacing with the sensors and the PC host.

|------------------------------|

In this repository we have the MATLAB script that is used to process and visualize the data acquired from all four sensors.

We also provide the code for the configuration of the Arduino
